  My role - Lead Project Manager / Project Engineer
  • The project - IBM’s mobile cyber range. IBM uses Oblong’s
  technology to drive their immersive cyber attack
  simulations for corporate and government audiences on a
  2+ year tour around Europe.
  • I was lead project manager, project engineer, and lead
  technician.
  • I drove the complex installation with 4 counterparties,
  including the software developers, the AV integrator, the
  client (IBM) and tour marketing company; Ensuring
  successful multi-day debut events in New York City,
  Washington D.C., and London.
  • Given the complexity and revolutionary nature of the
  project, it is still ongoing
